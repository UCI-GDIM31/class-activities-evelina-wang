Hello world!

### W2
Create future Devlog sub-headers with the three # symbols, then write your Devlogs below them.

because r,g and b will change in 0.1.
But bounce can be 1,2 and so on, it can't be 1.1
Each line end need ";" 
### W3
table 4 quesiton one.
Our table think input is float and output is boolean.
Float can tell the player timestamp of the beat to hit. And boolean tell the player whether or not the accurately hit.
I think the class is the bluemap, it is the foundation of all thing.Components with a metaphor is product actually create. And member variable is the "attributes" or "features" of a product. Method is the function of the product.And the ball get extremely bright because their code jump relate bright accumulated.

### W4
#Tables 4，“[SerializeField] private float _moveSpeed = 1.0f;” means definded the movespeed which is private and it can change in inspector. In float "translation = Input.GetAxis("Vertical") * _moveSpeed * Time.deltaTime;" is that accroding to the player to input to calculate the distance of vertical, finally save in translation."transform.Translate(0, 0, translation);" is the movement of object that the object can only move on Z aix. And the distance changing is depend by translation. In the activity, I choose cat and ball for rigidbody, and triggers is goal because it need to make coccerBall to through the goal.

### W5
The question I am intreseting is "when the vector kill the task" and answer is never.
I think variable members is cat and deer's movenment. In cat's movement, the method is Update().Because it need cat keep walking. And if deer follow cat also is Update(). If want deer just stay the place that cat stay and not follow is using start. In cat movement I need to Update the keycode to use.

### W6
